However, the Sultan opposes this love and sets a condition for Ferhad to pierce the mountains and bring water to the city to reach Shirin. While Ferhad, working with great love, pierces the mountains with chisel and hammer, he receives false news that Shirin has died and, unable to bear this pain, ends his life.\n\nThe Ferhad Waterways, still visible today, contribute to the historical texture of Amasya not only as an engineering marvel but also as a symbol of love and perseverance. This ancient waterway passing through the mountains integrates with the natural beauties of the city, offering visitors both a romantic and mystical atmosphere.
